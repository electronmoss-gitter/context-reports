EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This earthing study addresses the 132kV switching station and 33kV collection system for the proposed 50MW solar farm near Dalby, Queensland. The facility will connect to the Powerlink transmission network via a new 132kV line.

The earthing design considers the unique challenges of solar farm installations, including:
- Large geographical spread of equipment
- Lightning exposure of solar arrays
- Multiple voltage levels (132kV, 33kV, 1000V DC)
- Sandy soil with high resistivity

Soil resistivity measurements indicate highly resistive soil (450-850 Ωm), requiring an extensive earth electrode system to achieve acceptable earth resistance.

Key Results:
- 132kV switching station earth resistance: 1.85 Ω
- Touch potential (switching station): 892 V (within 945 V limit)
- Step potential (switching station): 2,180 V (within 2,890 V limit)
- Array earthing: Individual electrode systems per inverter station
- Lightning protection: Integrated with earthing system

The proposed design meets AS 2067, IEEE 80, and AS/NZS 5033 requirements.

EARTH RESISTANCE CALCULATIONS

Switching Station (Computer Modeling - CYMGRD):

Input Parameters:
- Soil model: Two-layer (450/850 Ωm)
- Grid area: 2,700 m²
- Grid conductor: 780m @ 0.8m depth
- Rods: 24 × 6m vertical + 6 × 10m deep electrodes
- Surface layer: 0.15m @ 3,500 Ωm

Results:
- Earth resistance: 1.85 Ω
- Maximum GPR: 58,275 V (at 31.5 kA fault)
- Maximum touch potential: 892 V
- Maximum step potential: 2,180 V

Tolerance Calculations (IEEE 80):
- Tolerable touch (0.3s, 70kg): Etouch = 945 V
- Tolerable step (0.3s, 70kg): Estep = 2,890 V

Safety Margins:
- Touch potential: 892 / 945 = 94% utilization → ACCEPTABLE
- Step potential: 2,180 / 2,890 = 75% utilization → ACCEPTABLE

Note: High soil resistivity results in higher than ideal GPR and touch potentials, but still within safe limits due to crushed rock surface layer and fast fault clearance (0.3s).


33kV INVERTER STATION EARTHING

Each inverter station (10 total) has an individual earthing system:

Earth Grid per Station:
- Dimensions: 25m × 20m = 500 m²
- Conductor: 70mm² bare copper
- Mesh: 5m × 5m
- Depth: 0.6m
- Conductor length: 135m per station

Electrodes per Station:
- 8 × 3m copper-bonded rods
- 2 × 6m deep rods at transformer location

Calculated Earth Resistance per Station:
- Typical: 3.5 - 5.0 Ω (varies with local soil conditions)
- Maximum acceptable: 5.0 Ω

All 10 inverter station earths are interconnected via:
- 33kV cable metallic screens (bonded both ends)
- Fiber optic cable metallic members
- Results in parallel resistance of all station earths
- Combined resistance at main switchboard: ~0.8 Ω

Touch/step potentials at inverter stations are well within limits due to:
- Lower fault currents (12.5 kA max, decreasing with distance)
- Longer fault clearance time (0.5s) allows higher tolerable voltages
- Personnel access restricted during fault conditions

CONCLUSION

The earthing system design for Darling Downs Solar Farm provides adequate protection despite challenging high-resistivity soil conditions. The 132kV switching station earth resistance of 1.85 Ω, while higher than typical low-resistivity sites, is acceptable for this voltage class and achieves safe touch and step potentials.

The distributed earthing approach for the 33kV inverter stations, interconnected via cable screens, provides an effective overall system. Solar array DC earthing integrates with the AC earthing to provide comprehensive lightning and fault protection.

Implementation of the specified design and adherence to testing requirements will result in a safe, compliant installation suitable for the 50MW solar generation facility.
